# **Helper file for 3D Gaussian Splatting**

## **Singularity container definition file**

The following definition files are intended for the NVIDIA GH200.

  - colmap.def : ffmpeg and colmap
  - opensplat.def : opensplat

## **COLMAP script**

Bash script to automate the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline using COLMAP in command-line mode. This script:
  - Extracts features from images
  - Matches features between images
  - Performs sparse reconstruction (SfM)
  - Undistorts images

## **Blur photo detection script**

The accuracy of models output by 3D Gaussian Splatting heavily depends on the input images used in COLMAP.
In particular, images extracted from videos are often blurry.
Such blurry images can lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the models generated by COLMAP. 
This script automatically removes blurry images.
  - Detect the object closest to the image center using YOLOv8.
  - Quantify the object's edges using a Laplacian filter.
  - If the computed value is below a threshold, classify the image as blurry and move it to a separate folder.

## **Sample output**

hibotan_2025.3.12.html is created with OpenSplat:
  - Record a video with an iPhone.
  - Extract images from the video using ffmpeg (5 images per second).
  - Estimate camera positions with COLMAP.
  - Create the model using OpenSplat.
  - Use SuperSplat Editor to remove noise and adjust coordinates, Export html file.
